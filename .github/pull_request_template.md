An example with Rules:
```python

>>> rule = Rule()
>>> rule.name = "My Rule"
>>> rule.description = "This is my rule"
>>> # Some input data
>>> data = pd.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2, 3], "B": [4, 5, 6]})

... # Add what the data should look like
```

These sorts of examples should also be in the docstrings of your code!
